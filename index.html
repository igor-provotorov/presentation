        <aside class="notes">
          CSS Grid Layout (aka "Grid"), is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system that aims to do nothing less than completely change the way we design grid-based user interfaces. CSS has always been used to lay out our web pages, but it's never done a very good job of it. First we used tables, then floats, positioning and inline-block, but all of these methods were essentially hacks and left out a lot of important functionality (vertical centering, for instance).

          <p><b style="color:#3b759e">CSS Grid Layout</b> is the most powerful layout system available in CSS. It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows, unlike flexbox which is largely a 1-dimensional system.</p>
          <h3>Flexbox vs Grid</h3>
          <img src="images/flexbox_vs_grid/flexbox_vs_grid_dimentions.png" alt="Flexbox VS Grid" width="90%">
          <aside class="notes">
            Flexbox helped out, and also Flexbox and css grids share some similarities but the one differences is that the flexbox controls how items flow in one dimention whereas grid controls how items flow in two dimentions. The core difference between Grids and Flex is  that Flexbox lets content size itself based on space available or the dimentions of the content itself. Flex is great of handling alignment, distribution and order.

          Instead of Flexboxes Grid specifies nothing about how the individual items themselves should be sized. And these items are created in grid container for sizing into.
          The css grid items are aligned in rows and columns and exist in or span across cells but they did not rely on content structure like tables do, so it allow much more flexibility.</aside>

          <h3>Grid Container</h3>
          <p>Create a grid container by setting the <b style="color:#3b759e">display</b> property with a value of <b style="color:#3b759e">grid</b> or <b style="color:#3b759e">inline-grid</b>. All direct children of grid containers become grid items.</p>

            A quick example if you want to create a
            grid container you have this like new
            value for the display property called
            grid or inline grid depending and if you
            notice that in comparison to Flex blocks
            flex box by default aligns items and
            columns whereas by default if you just
            drop a display grid it sets all of the
            items in rows

          <h3>Explicit Grid</h3>
          <p>Explicitly set a grid by creating columns and rows with the <b style="color:#3b759e">grid-template-columns</b> and <b style="color:#3b759e">grid-template-rows</b> properties.</p>
          <aside class="notes">                        
            so now we're going to
            start defining a grid so here we're
            explaining what's called an explicit
            grid and we're
            telling it to create column tracks and
            row tracks. so I have two different
            properties the grid display - grid
            template rows, and grid template columns
            properties
          </aside>

        <section>
          <p>A row track is created for each value specified for <span style="color:#3b759e">grid-template-rows</span>. Track size values can be any non-negative, length value (<span style="color:#3b759e">px, %, em, etc.</span>)</p>
          <small>
            <p>Items 1 and 2 have fixed heights of <span style="color:#3b759e">50px</span> and <span style="color:#3b759e">100px</span>.</p>
            <p>Because only 2 row tracks were defined, heights of items 3 and 4 are defined by the contents of each.</p>

            <p>Items 4, 5 and 6 were placed on a new row track because only 3 column track sizes were defined; and because they were placed in column tracks 1, 2 and 3, their column sizes are equal to items 1, 2 and 3.</p>
            <p>Grid items 1, 2 and 3 have fixed widths of <span style="color:#3b759e">90px</span>, <span style="color:#3b759e">50px</span> and <span style="color:#3b759e">120px</span> respectively.</p>

          <p>The <b style="color:#3b759e">fr</b> unit helps create flexible grid tracks. It represents a fraction of the available space in the grid container (works like Flexbox’s unitless values).</p>            
          <small><p>In this example, items 1 and 2 take up the first two (of four) sections while item 3 takes up the last two.</p></small>

            but if you're noticing these are
            fixed width values and so we're talking
            about the responsive web's
            well grid also has this it introduces a
            new unit which is really really cool
            call the FR or the fraction so it's
            very similar to the flexbox unitless
            values and FR represents the fraction
            of the available space in the across the
            grid container.                    
            in this example we
            have 2 columns defined at one fr each
            and third column defined at two fr.
            so it's just going to take all of the
            available space in the grid container
            separate it into 3 sections and then
            just evenly distribute it across the
            columns.

          <h3>Minimum and Maximum Grid Track Sizes</h3>
          <p>Tracks sizes can be defined to have a minimum and/or maximum size with the <b style="color:#3b759e">minmax()</b> function.</p>                  
          <p>The <span style="color:#3b759e">minmax()</span> function accepts 2 arguments: the first is the minimum size of the track and the second the maximum size. Alongside length values, the values can also be <span style="color:#3b759e">auto</span>, which allows the track to grow/stretch based on the size of the content.</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            There's this also min Max function. It's
            this new function you can use inside of
            the value when defining grid sizes so
            you can tell it to have like a minimum
            size and a maximum size and the default
            value is auto based on like the content.

The first column track has a minimum size of <span style="color:#3b759e">auto</span>, but its maximum size of <span style="color:#3b759e">50%</span> will prevent it from getting no wider than <span style="color:#3b759e">50%</span> of the grid container width.</p>

            You can also
            combine the repeat function with other
            track fixed width values or flexible
            values so here you have the first and
            last columns at 30 pixels and then in
            between instead of defining like 1 fr 1
            fr 1 fr I'm just saying ok let's repeat
            3 columns at 1 fr and then it's just
            going to distribute it the available
            space across the defined columns.

          <h3>Grid Gaps (Gutters)</h3>
          <p>The <span style="color:#3b759e">grid-column-gap</span> and <span style="color:#3b759e">grid-row-gap</span> properties create gutters between columns and rows.</p>
          <p>Grid gaps are only created in between columns and rows, and not along the edge of the grid container.</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            So we
            have grid gaps I the frustration about
            flexbox about evenly spacing out the
            items grid gap solves all of these
            issues so here we have a defined grid
            and there's two different properties the
            grid row gap and the grid column gap and
            the wonderful thing is it doesn't touch
            the outer edge of the grid container it
            no it's smart enough to say ok I just
            want to evenly spaced out the actual
            items and I don't need to add additional
            spacing around the container which is
            really cool.

          <h3>Naming and Positioning Items by Grid Areas</h3>
          <p>Like grid line names, grid areas can also be named with the <span style="color:#3b759e">grid-template-areas</span> property. Names can then be referenced to position grid items.</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            another really cool thing is now you're naming
            grid areas you can take like an entire
            block or a section of a grid and likeIMPLICITLY NAMED GRID AREAS
            say I want this to be the header or I
            want this to be the footer and then you
            can like take items and like position
            them into the appropriate places.
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Sets of names should be surrounded in single or double quotes, and each name separated by a whitespace. Each set of names defines a row, and each name defines a column.</p>
          <div style="width: 50%; float: left;">

                  grid-template-areas:
                    "header header"
                    "content sidebar"
                    "footer footer";
                  grid-template-rows: 150px 1fr 100px;
                  grid-template-columns: 1fr 200px;

            so here
            this is just an example you are we have
            the grid template areas property and
            then you're using like the syntax to say
            I have two columns on the first row and
            that entire block I want to name it
            header and then on the second row I have
            content on the Left sidebar on the right
            and on the last row I just want the

          <h3>Implicit Grid</h3>
          <p>An implicit grid is created when a grid needs to position items outside of the explicit grid because there isn’t enough space for items in the explicitly defined tracks or you decide to position something outside of the explicit grid. Those items are then auto-placed in the implicit grid.</p>
          <p>The implicit grid can be defined using the <span style="color:#3b759e">grid-auto-rows</span>, <span style="color:#3b759e">grid-auto-columns</span>, and <span style="color:#3b759e">grid-auto-flow</span> properties.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>In this example we’ve only defined one row track, therefore grid items 1 and 2 are <span style="color:#3b759e">70px</span> tall.</p>
          <small style="margin-top: -25px">              
            <p>A second row track was auto-created to make room for items 3 and 4. <span style="color:#3b759e">grid-auto-rows</span> defines the row track sizes in the implicit grid, which is reflected by the the <span style="color:#3b759e">140px</span> heights of items 3 and 4.</p>

          <small>
            <p>CSS GRID layout is supported by all modern browsers</p>
          </small>
          <aside class="notes">
            so what does grid
            support?
            look like good support is
            actually surprisingly pretty good so
            this is just a screenshot from caniuse.com
            that I took a couple days ago and
            you'll notice the partial support for
            IE and edge.
            Surprisingly the spec for
            grid came from Microsoft, so it's been in
            development for over five years and
            because the spec has kind of like
            evolved, it's kind of falling behind, but
            I believe my understanding is edge will
            catch up and I'm not 100% sure about ie.
